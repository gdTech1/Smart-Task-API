# Smart Task API

### Intelligent task management API powered by Python & FastAPI

A smart backend system that goes beyond CRUD, it analyzes tasks, estimates priority, and suggests focus time using simple intelligence rules.

# Overview

**Smart Task API** is an intelligent task management system built with **FastAPI**.  
Instead of just storing tasks, it **analyzes and enriches them** with smart metadata such as:

- Priority scoring
- Suggested focus time
- Task classification
- Productivity insights (rule-based logic)

This project simulates the backend of a **modern productivity SaaS platform**.

---

# Key Features

## Core Functionality
- Create tasks
- Read tasks
- Update tasks
- Delete tasks

## Smart Intelligence Layer
- Automatic priority classification
- Suggested execution time
- Task complexity estimation (rule-based)
- Productivity hints based on input

---

# Example Response

```json
{
  "task": "Study FastAPI for 2 hours",
  "priority": "high",
  "complexity": "medium",
  "suggested_focus_time": "2h deep work session",
  "reason": "learning task with medium complexity and long duration"
}
```

## Tech Stack
- Python 
- FastAPI
- Pydantic
- Uvicorn
- SQLite (or PostgreSQL optional)

### Installation & Setup
**1. Clone repository**

git clone https://github.com/your-username/smart-task-api.git

cd smart-task-api

**2. Create virtual environment**

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

**3. Install dependencies**

pip install -r requirements.txt

**4. Run server**

uvicorn app.main:app --reload

---

## API Endpoints

- Create Task
POST /tasks
- Get All Tasks
GET /tasks
- Update Task
PUT /tasks/{id}
- Delete Task
DELETE /tasks/{id}

---

## Smart Logic Concept
The intelligence layer uses simple rules such as:

- Long description → higher complexity
- Words like "study", "learn" → high priority
- Short urgent tasks → immediate focus suggestion

This simulates how real productivity AI systems structure tasks.

---

## Project Goals

This project was built to demonstrate:

- Clean API architecture
- Backend engineering skills
- Basic AI-like logic implementation
- Scalable project structure
- Production-style documentation

---

### Future Improvements
- Machine Learning-based priority prediction
- User authentication (JWT)
- PostgreSQL integration
- Task analytics dashboard
- Daily productivity scoring system
